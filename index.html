        " Blackbeard, byname of Edward Teach, Teach also spelled Thatch or Thack, (born c. 1680, Bristol?, 
        England—died November 22, 1718, Ocracoke Island, North Carolina [U.S.]), 
        one of history's most famous pirates, who became an imposing figure in American folklore.
        Little is known of Blackbeard's early life, and his origins have been left to speculation. 
        He has been widely identified as Edward Teach (or several variations thereof, including Thatch and Thack),
        though pirate custom at the time was to use a pseudonym when engaging in acts of piracy, and his true name will probably never be known. "

            " In the early 1700s, Blackbeard captured dozens of merchant vessels in the Caribbean and along the Atlantic Coast. 
            In 1718, he raided Charleston, South Carolina, seized many ships, and demanded a ransom for 
            “several of the best inhabitants of this place.”

        <h4>
        Blackbeard's Death
        </h4>
        <p4>
           " Lieutenant Robert Maynard “an experienced Officer, and a Gentleman of great Bravery and Resolution” 
            finally killed Blackbeard, in a bloody battle at the mouth of the Okracoke Inlet. Maynard and Blackbeard 
            clashed in a sword duel which saw Blackbeard sustain more than twenty wounds. We are told though:

            “he stood his Ground, and fought with great Fury, till he received five and twenty Wounds, and five of them by Shot. 
            At length, as he was cocking another Pistol (famously carrying three pairs slung across his shoulders), 
            having fired several before, he fell down dead”. "
